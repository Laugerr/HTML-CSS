        <h1>Aurora Athmospheric Phenomenon</h1>
        <br>
            <h4>
                <p><strong>Aurora</strong>, luminous phenomenon of <em>Earth’s</em> upper <em>atmosphere</em> that occurs primarily in high latitudes of both hemispheres; auroras in the Northern Hemisphere are called aurora borealis, aurora polaris, or <em>northen lights</em>, and in the Southern Hemisphere aurora australis, or <em>southern lights</em>.</p>
            </h4>
                <br>
            <p>A brief treatment of auroras follows. For full treatment, see <em><strong>ionosphere and magnetosphere</strong></em>.<br>Auroras are caused by the interaction of energetic particles (<em>electrons</em> and <em>protons</em>) of the <strong>solar wind</strong> with <strong>atoms</strong> of the upper atmosphere. Such interaction is confined for the most part to high latitudes in oval-shaped zones that surround Earth’s magnetic poles and maintain a more or less fixed orientation with respect to the Sun. During periods of low solar activity, the auroral zones shift poleward. During periods of intense solar activity, auroras occasionally extend to the middle latitudes; for example, the aurora borealis has been seen as far south as <strong>40°</strong> latitude in the <em>United States</em>. Auroral emissions typically occur at altitudes of about <strong>100 km</strong> (60 miles); however, they may occur anywhere between <strong>80</strong> and <strong>250 km</strong> (about 50 to 155 miles) above Earth’s surface.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Auroras take many forms, including luminous curtains, arcs, bands, and patches. The uniform arc is the most stable form of aurora, sometimes persisting for hours without noticeable variation. However, in a great display, other forms appear, commonly undergoing dramatic variation. The lower edges of the arcs and folds are usually much more sharply defined than the upper parts. Greenish rays may cover most of the sky poleward of the magnetic zenith, ending in an arc that is usually folded and sometimes edged with a lower red border that may ripple like drapery. The display ends with a poleward retreat of the auroral forms, the rays gradually degenerating into diffuse areas of white <em>light</em></p>
            <h3>These destinations will inspire even the most experienced aurora chaser.</h3>
